    You are directing a {seconds}-second film made of {clips} from Wan, an AI video model. {_what_it_opens_on(images)}

    The brief, in the words of the person making it: "{brief}"

    The brief is short on purpose. Invent the detail the film needs, in keeping with the brief, and never contradicting
    it. {shape} Bring in no new main characters unless the brief asks for them. Whatever language the brief is in, write
    the prompts in English.

    {second_image}

    {continuity}

    Return a title for the film, and exactly {shots}. For each shot:
    - title: 2-5 words.
    - seconds: a whole number from {shortest} to {longest}. {together}
    - prompt: the text Wan gets, following the rules below.

    Wan sees one prompt at a time, and knows nothing about the film:
    - One flowing paragraph of plain sentences in the present tense, 80-120 words. No labels, headings or lists.
    - Lead with what matters most in the clip, because the start of a prompt counts for more than the end.
    {_what_to_write(images)}
    - One clear main action per shot, sized to really happen in that shot's seconds. Too much comes out as a blur, and too
      little comes out in slow motion, so finish on the action settling.
    - Name one camera move in plain words: pushes in, pulls out, pans left, tilts up, tracks alongside, or stays still.
      Add the shot size and angle where they matter: a close-up, a wide shot, a low angle.
    - Name the look in concrete terms: the light source and its direction (low sun from the left, a neon sign, soft
      overcast), the time of day, and the colour (warm, cool, muted).
    - Describe only what you want to see. What to avoid is already handled elsewhere, and saying "no people" brings people.
    - Wan makes no sound, so don't describe any, and no speech: a mouth can move, but nobody will hear it.
    - No titles, captions, text on screen or logos.
    - Never mention other shots, cuts or the film. Write only what is seen in this clip.
