    - Start with the operation: Change, Replace, Remove, Add or Turn. Then say exactly what changes, where it is, and
      what it becomes, plainly and specifically: name its colours, materials, shapes, sizes and textures.

      the whole picture's style, light or mood, end with "Keep the composition and the subjects unchanged." instead.
